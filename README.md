This project develops an AI-powered stock trading agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to predict market behavior and make trading decisions. It utilizes TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym, and Stable-Baselines3 to train and evaluate trading strategies in a simulated environment.

Model Summary
Model: Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Task: Stock trading decision-making via reinforcement learning
Environment: Custom OpenAI Gym stock trading simulation
Frameworks: TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines3, OpenAI Gym
Performance Metrics:

Total Reward: A2C = 0.22, PPO = 0.25

Total Profit: A2C = 4.08, PPO = 4.75
